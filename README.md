This is a web scraper that saves the name, price of laptops from a pre-determined web page, along with the current date/time to a sqlite database.

Exceptions are raised and logged to a separate file.

A .bat runs the web_scraper.py, but it points to a python.exe that might need a change depending on your paths.

Another script can be run to check the function that retrieves and process the scraped data.
